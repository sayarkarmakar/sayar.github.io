# Hi, this is Kushal

I am currently a graduate student at University of Chicago, Department of Statistics and working in [Matthew Stephens lab](http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/). My primary research area is Statistical genomics, in particular, analyzing RNA-seq data and trying to investigate the cell-type or tissue-type effects from multiple sample single cell/ bulk RNA sequencing. Besides this, I am also working on Ancient DNA data analysis, phylogenetics and metagenomics data.

Besides, I have been actively involved in applications of statistics to nano sciences and medical sciences. I had the fortune of working on statistical applications in systems biology as an intern in [Bison Lab, ETH Zurich](http://www.bison.ethz.ch/people/heinz_koeppl/heinz_koeppl) under Prof. Heinz Koeppl in 2013. In theoretical statistics, my past works include developing an efficient clustering algorithm  under hidden subpopulations, methods for improved statistical quality control and building the theroretical background on optimal scaling and ergodic nature of a rival simulation algorithm to MCMC, called TMCMC (transformation based Markov Chain Monte Carlo). 

Before coming to University of Chicago, I did my undergraduate and Masters in Statistics at the Indian Statistical Institute. For my masters dissertation, I worked on Bayesian computation and TMCMC with [Dr.Sourabh Bhattacharya](http://www.isical.ac.in/~biru/sb.html).
