 An R package to perform, visualize and annotate clustering of counts data using graded membership model.
 An R/C++ package to perform transformation based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC) approaches. Besides TMCMC and standard RWMH, it also has implementations of various adaptive versions of TMCMC and RWMH (SCAM, RAMA and Atchadeâ€™s methods) and Metropolis coupling versions (fixed and randomized update).
 An R package to perform re-ordering of single cells on the cell cycle based on sinusoidal cell-cycle gene patterns, tested both for synchronized and unsynchronized single cell experiments.
 An R pipeline for performing adaptive shrinkage on correlation matrix using ash due to Matthew Stephens. Check the R package ashr for documentation and details on how to use the adaptive shrinkage method.
