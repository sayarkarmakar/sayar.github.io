title: "Draft Open Access Policy"
---

The
[University Library Committee](https://www.library.wisc.edu/about/university-library-committee/)
at the [University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison](http://www.wisc.edu)
has formed a working group to develop an Open Access Policy for
UW&ndash;Madison, through which university researchers would give
UW&ndash;Madison the right to freely distribute pre-prints of all
published journal articles.

The following is an initial draft of such a policy, based closely on the policy
at the University of
[Minnesota](http://www.policy.umn.edu/Policies/Research/SCHOLARLYARTICLES.html).

We have also drafted [an implementation plan](oa_implementation.html)
and a set of [anticipated questions (and our responses)](oa_questions.html).

Our intention is for this to provide a starting point for discussion,
with changes and suggestions both expected and welcomed.

### Draft Open Access Policy

In the spirit of the [Wisconsin Idea](https://wisconsinidea.wisc.edu/)
(the principle that "the university should improve people's lives
beyond the classroom"), researchers should seek to ensure the broad
accessibility of their scholarly articles, which are the primary
products of their research efforts. Towards this aim, and also
to simplify authors' retention of distribution rights and aid
preservation, the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison has adopted
the following Open Access Policy.

Each faculty member grants to the University of
Wisconsin&ndash;Madison a shared, limited right to make available his
or her scholarly articles and to reproduce, display, and distribute
those articles for the purpose of open access. More specifically, each
faculty member grants the University of
Wisconsin&ndash;Madison a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free,
worldwide license to exercise such rights under copyright as are
necessary to achieve the goals of open access, dissemination, and
preservation, provided that the articles are not sold for profit, and
to authorize others to do the same.

The author retains copyright ownership, unless that author chooses to
transfer rights to other parties, such as a publisher. The University
retains only the limited rights outlined above.

The policy applies to all scholarly articles authored or co-authored
while the person is a faculty member at the University of
Wisconsin&ndash;Madison, except for any articles completed before the
adoption of this policy and any articles for which the author entered
into an incompatible licensing or assignment agreement before the
adoption of this policy.

The Vice Chancellor for Research or his/her designate will waive
application of the license for a particular article or delay access
for a specified period of time upon express direction by a faculty
member. Grant of such a waiver is mandatory and not at the discretion of
any person or group. Waiver requests must be made in writing, or via a
an online form that will be made available for this specific purpose.

The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research will be responsible for
interpreting this policy, resolving any dispute concerning its
interpretation and application, and recommending changes.
The policy will be reviewed after three years and a report presented
to the Faculty Senate.

The University Library will be responsible for implementing services
to support article processing and to communicate with authors about
deposition of particular works.
